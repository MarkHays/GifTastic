# GifTastic
What the project does - Allows users to search for a gif by keyword and displays 10 of those gifs on the page and when you click on them they animate and click again to stop. the user can also get information on the gif like the rating, title, embedded url. 

Why the project is useful - the project is a good learning experience to learn how api's work and how to call to them using jquery. 

How users can get started with the project - users need to obtain their own api key from giphy to get started with this project.

Where users can get help with your project - if you would like to make the data persist into local storage or cookies. also add a download button for each of the gifs displayed. also add the ability for users to save gifs to the a favorite section
